# TODO for PellsBawl v1.0

I really want to improve on this game. It feels so good at the moment, but I know it can get even
better and reach the stars.

### Pells Bawl character movements

There are certain movements, that feel a little jerky. Also I need to fix the compositing issue
on linux.

- Check with AI on Wayland/compositing
- Make a list of movements that feel a little off
    * Jumping/double jump
    * Landing
- Check with visible character rectangle and without
    * Maybe introduce a point size resting object?

### Data driven model

- Do all the necessary knobs for level pickup etc in the level designer.
- On complex objects (like a gong-gong that halts the scrolling on hit, while the player
bounces off into oblivion), there should be some text input for a command on the entity c++ object.
- GameState object that carries all info including main character, controllers etc.


### Graphics for the ski-ramp level

I really need some snowy graphics for this one!

### More enemies

I want some really sad looking enemies that are entirely non-dangerous.

### Idea : Make the ski-scene throw him into a boxing glove or a large gong-gong

I don't know, if I am ready to chip in the work for this. Let's see.

### Go into a grotto and find MT2 and realease him

With super multi-layered parallax scene with Michellangelo God scene in the middle.
+ Dramatic choire music.

### And more music and sounds

Yeah.
